Wow, okay, so Picture This. I just waddled out of the theater like some intoxicated penguin. You know that feeling when your brain’s full of static and you can’t tell if it’s from the   or the busted speaker behind you squawking like a deranged parrot? Yeah, that. Whooo boy.

The opening scene’s still shaking around my head like marbles in a can. There was this light—a blinding, warmth-like-apricot-jam kind of light—that spilled over everything. I was picking popcorn crumbs off my sweater, wondering if this was a sign to cut back on snack abuse. Canon vs. Nikon arguments feel like petty squabbles in a flea circus after seeing that light spill, honestly. My back was aching hard like I tried to be a contortionist in those stupidly cramped seats. All for art or…whatever.

> That one bit in the middle where, you know, they use that...contrast, like shadow puppets fighting in a sunbeam—couldn’t make out if it was a dream sequence or just a dream. What’s even real anyway? Made me wanna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later just so I can pause and dissect every Godforsaken detail.

And speaking of details, the dialogue—sometimes hitting like a jazz drum on Tuesday, other times like you’re eavesdropping on an alien trying to describe what ice cream feels like. Melts your brain in the most curious way. I think someone behind me was actually chewing on a pair of binoculars? Never took my eyes off the screen long enough to check.

Closure, what is that even? The ending had a finish like a slice of cucumber dropped in the forest; crisp, green, and lost among the leaves. Meanwhile, someone next to me was whispering—probably Lana from the studio—about how she can’t wait to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, unravel more.

Okay, jumping back to the sound, you ever hear a soundtrack that’s like a ghost purring in a cat’s body? Yeah, it’s like that but with trumpets. Or maybe French horns? Not sure. I should know this, right? As a photographer, I say sound’s like light’s misunderstood cousin.
